This repository contains the v1.0 foundational prototype of the Adaptive Learning Organism, a project designed to serve as the **cognitive "spine"** for an autonomous learning ecosystem tailored for professional trades training.

## Vision

The vision is to build an intelligent instructional agent for a future **Mastery-as-a-Platform (MTPaaP)**. This prototype proves that an expert tutor's adaptive feedback loop can be codified into a modular, testable, and resilient system.

## Project Structure

See directory tree in repo.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `pip` and `venv`
